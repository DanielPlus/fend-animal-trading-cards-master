				Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth, and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold.
				Adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black and also vary in length.
				The length and color of the mane is believed to be determined by such factors as age, genetics and hormones.
				Young lions have light spotting on their coats that will disappear as they grow up. Without their coats,
				lion and tiger bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart.
